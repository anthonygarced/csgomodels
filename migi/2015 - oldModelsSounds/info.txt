incase you haven't noticed already, on workshop maps like de_dust2_old, old models don't work correcly.

simple fix is this funny little "de_dust2_old.kv" file here

what this file does is define what player models will be used when the map is loaded, in this case i've set them to the
correct models needed, so my cool looking 2015 player models will apply.
