# CSGO Models

This repository hosts a lot of CS:GO models. You can use the models via your own server to use, or through the use of modded clients.
Please note that some of the models here may be broken or not. If they are, make an issue on this repository and I'll make sure to note it, and try to find a working model on the internet.

How to install the models:
1. Make sure to install the zip file(s) of all of the .vvf and .vtf extensions for the models you want

# How to use the models (via cheats):

We will now be going over how to use these models via modded clients. If you are not using modded clients (e.g Gamesense, Neverlose, Primordial, Pandora, so on and soforth), then Ctrl + F over to the server section.
