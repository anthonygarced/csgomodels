<h1 align="center">CSGO Sounds, Skyboxes, & Models</h1>

This repository hosts a lot of CS:GO models. You can use the models via your own server to use, or through the use of modded clients.
Please note that some of the models here may be broken or not. If they are, make an issue on this repository and I'll make sure to note it, and try to find a working model on the internet. This will also contains CS:GO source and skyboxes and such for you to install.

Skyboxes:

1. Get the ZIP file of a skybox you want (e.g Glorius Morning)
2. Open the folder in File Explorer and extract the files (keep this folder open for step 5)
3. Open Steam and go to library, right click Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Manage -> Browse Local Files
4. Hit csgo, then materials, then skybox (You should be at C:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\materials\skybox)
5. In the folder you got, put all of the files you extracted and drag them all into the skybox folder
6. If you have CS:GO open while injected (e.g Neverlose, Gamesense), you may need to restart your game for the client to see these files
